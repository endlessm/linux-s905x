#include "meson_modes.h"

/* XXX: This table is a horrible hack. Basically, the amlogic HDMI drivers
 * have its own set of output display modes in its code, in an enum called
 * vmode_t, and they are things like `VMODE_480P`, `VMODE_1080P`. We need
 * to map the standard modes that KMS supplies to
 *
 * The obvious way to do this would be to match on the mode name that
 * drm_edid.c assigns to each mode, but for some reason, under very
 * specific circumstances like hotplug, Xorg seems to hand us a mode with
 * a blank name and I'm not sure why. So just cheat and only match on the
 * hdisplay/vdisplay/vrefresh.
 */

/* XXX: Replace this with our own HDMI driver eventually? */

/* In order to add modes to this table, you need to match up four pieces
 * of information:
 *
 *  1. drm_edid.c keeps a giant list of standard HDMI modes in a table
 *     called "edid_cea_modes". Each mode contains above it a comment with the
 *     standard mode name and a number, the "VIC" (Video Identification Code).
 *
 *  2. include/linux/amlogic/hdmi_tx/hdmi_info_global.h has a giant list of
 *     VICs, "HDMI_Video_Codes_t", which match up to the ones that DRM has
 *     (the values are from the same specification, CEA-861).
 *
 *  3. drivers/amlogic/hdmi/hdmi_tx/hdmi_tx_edid.c has a table of mode names
 *     to HDMI VICs, "dispmode_VIC_tab". Find the mode name for the VIC you
 *     got in step 2.
 *
 *  4. drivers/amlogic/display/vout/tvconf.c has a table of mode names that
 *     match up to vmode_t's, "tv_info". Find the mode name from step 3 and
 *     match it with the vmode_t.
 *
 *  5. Steal the vdisplay/hdisplay/vrefresh attributes from DRM's mode table
 *     and the vmode_t from Step 4 and insert them into the table. It's just
 *     that simple!
 *
 * Alternatively, you can just guess at the correct values. That works too.
