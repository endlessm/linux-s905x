Package: nic-modules
Priority: standard
Description: Network card modules for Sparc kernels
 This package contains the drivers for the Happy Meal/Big Mac 10/100BaseT,
 Sun QuadEthernet and MyriCOM Gigabit Ethernet SBus devices for SPARC
 systems, as well as various PCI NIC drivers (only on sparc64.)
 .
 Do not install this package on a real Debian system! You probably
 want a kernel-image package instead.
