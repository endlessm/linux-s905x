Subject: [PATCH] sched: Fix broken setscheduler()
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/3.14/patches-3.14.12-rt9.tar.xz

I decided to run my tests on linux-next, and my wakeup_rt tracer was
broken. After running a bisect, I found that the problem commit was:

   linux-next commit c365c292d059
   "sched: Consider pi boosting in setscheduler()"

And the reason the wake_rt tracer test was failing, was because it had
no RT task to trace. I first noticed this when running with
sched_switch event and saw that my RT task still had normal SCHED_OTHER
priority. Looking at the problem commit, I found:

 -       p->normal_prio = normal_prio(p);
 -       p->prio = rt_mutex_getprio(p);

With no

 +       p->normal_prio = normal_prio(p);
 +       p->prio = rt_mutex_getprio(p);

Reading what the commit is suppose to do, I realize that the p->prio
can't be set if the task is boosted with a higher prio, but the
p->normal_prio still needs to be set regardless, otherwise, when the
task is deboosted, it wont get the new priority.

The p->prio has to be set before "check_class_changed()" is called,
otherwise the class wont be changed.

Also added fix to newprio to include a check for deadline policy that
was missing. This change was suggested by Juri Lelli.
